* SETUP
    1) git clone this project or download it.
    2) cd into the project
    3) run the following commands: 
        * npm install
        * npm run dev

    If this is the first time running the bot, the terminal will prompt
    you for your bot's token and server's guild id. This will create your
    bot's .env configuration automatically. This information is not stored
    anywhere but locally on your device.

    If you wish to manually set up the .env, follow this format:
        BOT_TOKEN=your_token_here
        BOT_GUILD=your_server_guild_id_here

        place this file in the projects root directory (dir with main.ts)

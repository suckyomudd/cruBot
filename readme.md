# cruBot DOCS

## SETUP
run the following commands in your terminal
```
git clone https://github.com/suckyomudd/cruBot.git
cd cruBot
npm install
npm run dev
```

If this is the first time running the bot, the terminal will prompt
you for your bot's token and server's guild id. This will create your
bot's .env configuration automatically. This information is not stored
anywhere but locally on your device.

If you wish to manually set up the .env, follow this format:
    BOT_TOKEN=your_token_here
    BOT_GUILD=your_server_guild_id_here

place this file in the projects root directory (dir with main.ts)
